At Oregon State University, our campus is like a colorful collage, filled with students coming
from diverse cultures, countries, ages, gender and majors. Yet, within this rich mosaic, countless
remarkable stories often go untold or suppressed. Stories connect us and foster understanding
and every student bears a story worth sharing. Picture a space where these stories take center
stage – a spot where a student’s journey is celebrated and shared. Such a platform would not
only inspire but also foster a profound sense of connection within our community, allowing an
individual to feel represented.

Virtual Reality (VR) steps in as a powerful tool to create these narrative spaces, breaking free
from physical limitations and offering accessibility to all. Through VR, we plan to craft a virtual world
that transcends distance, giving voice to every story and building stronger bonds within our
diverse community.
